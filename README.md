### What I learned

Viewing the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size. Using Sass to save time while styling the web page.

### Continued development

I wish to be familiar with the use of CSS Preprocessors. I had to admit I am extremely unfamiliar with them and I do realize the first step is ALWAYS the hardest.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Layout Generator](https://layout.bradwoods.io/customize) - This helped me with grids.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows me to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
